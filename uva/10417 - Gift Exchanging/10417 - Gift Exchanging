probability

Let C denote the current gift distribution, X0 be the gift the first guest brought, and gi be the number of gift i. Then this problem is to calculate max{P(X0=i|C)/gi} among all gift i.
Since there are at most 12 guests, we can enumerate all possible cases. So we can use DFS.

0.020s in uva 10417

My old algorithm uses std::next_permutation() to enumerate all possible cases. It ran 0.040s in uva 10417. It's slower because it didn't filter out those impossible cases (probability of 0).
