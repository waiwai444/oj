simple math

Use backtracking on each digit of each left number.
Since thereâ€™re at most 7 different characters, lots of recursive calls are deterministic. 

My algorithm without pruning cost 0.092s in uva and 0.110s in poj. 
When with some pruning of the first digit of each left number, it ran in 0.047s in poj. 
But with the pruning that directly avoid those cases where the three numbers have the same length and the first digits of the right-hand one and one of the left-hand ones have the same character, the time cost was reduced to 0.015s in uva and 0s in poj.

0.000s in poj
0.015s in uva

Same problem:
	poj 1213
