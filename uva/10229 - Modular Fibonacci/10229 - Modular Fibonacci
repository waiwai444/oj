math, Fibonacci sequence

It's similar to uva 10518, and can be solved by the similar method. However, since in this problem, the modulo base is quite larger here, the algorithm I currently used in uva 10518 will not so efficient enough here (0.020s).
There is a much quicker algorithm that employs the Fibonacci Q-Matrix and the exponentiation by squaring for matrices.
The Fibonacci Q-Matrix is an equation:
[F_(n+1) F_n] = [1 1]^n
 F_n F_(n-1)     1 0
