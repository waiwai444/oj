number theory

It's a "Good Choice" iff STEP and MOD are relatively prime. The proof is easy. 
Proof:
Denote the numbers from 0 (the start number) to the first another 0 as r0(=0), r1, ..., rk, r_{k+1}(=0). Then we have (k+1)*STEP%MOD = 0, i.e. MOD | (k+1)*STEP.
If STEP and MOD are relatively prime, then MOD | (k+1). Hence, we have MOD = k+1, that is, it can traverse all numbers in [0,MOD-1]. If STEP and MOD are not relatively prime, then k+1 will be less than MOD.
