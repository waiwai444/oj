A standard way to play the Hanoi tower problem:
  1. Move the smallest disk (disk of size 1) to the next peg (or the previous peg, depending on which peg you want to move the whole tower to).
  2. Move the only possible move on the other two pegs.
  3. Repeat 1 and 2 until all disks are moved to the target peg.
It can be easily proved by induction that this algorithm will achieve the goal with the optimal number of moves (2^n-1).
