We can simulate the process of encrypting repeatedly for k times for each encryption task, but it would be much slower.
To improve the efficiency, we can first construct the chains of substitutions, as exemplified below:
	Encryption key: 4 5 3 7 2 8 1 6 10 9
	For example, character in position 1 is moved to position 4, and 4 to 7, and 7 to 1. So, (1, 4, 7) is a chain of substitutions. Also, (2, 5), (3), (6, 8), (9, 10) are chains of substitutions.
Hence, after the construction of such chains of substitutions, we can easily obtain the cipher which may require iteration of substitutions in one run by modulo arithmetic.
