Let f(k,d) denotes the number of labelings of the k-ary complete tree with depth d, and n(k,d) the number of nodes in such a tree.
Then f(k,d) = [f(k,d-1)]^k*C(n(k,d)-1, n(k,d-1))*C(n(k,d)-1-n(k,d-1), n(k,d-1))*...*C(n(k,d-1),n(k,d-1))
			= [f(k,d-1)]^k*[n(k,d)-1]!/[n(k,d)!]^k
Expand this iteration equation, we have:
f(k,d) = [n(k,d)-1]!/[n(k,d-1)]^k/[n(k,d-2)]^k^2/.../[n(k,1)]^k^(d-1)

The time cost of the final code in UVa is 0.332s (time limit 15s).

p.s. In order to speed up the division operation of big integers, we can use binary search to find the digits of quotient.
