math, probability

Let P(n) be the probability for n kids. Then
	P(n) = 1-C(n-2, n/2-1)*(1/2)^(n-2),
	where C is the combinatorial number.
We can use an equation to recursively compute P(n):
	P(n) = 1-(1-P(n-2))*(n-2)*(n-3)/(n/2-1)^2/4
Otherwise, it will be very inefficient to compute all P(n) independently.
