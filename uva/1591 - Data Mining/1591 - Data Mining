It has nothing to do with data mining...

Didn't have any idea about this problem until referring to other's analysis.
The description of this problem has at least two mistakes. One is the precedence of operators in equation (4). It should be (Pofs(i)+(Pofs(i)<<A))>>B. The other is "(where K <= N*SQ)". It's obviously nonsense that the total amounts of memory will be less than or equal to N*SQ. In fact, it should be K >= N*SQ.

Although the text doesn't mention, both A and B are less than 32. So we can simply enumerate all possible combinations and check the resulting K values.
