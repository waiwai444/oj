probability, dp

It's about posterior probability. Let Xi be the event that the i'th buyer has bought something, R be the event of r buyers has bought something. Then we need to compute P(Xi|R) = P(Xi*R)/P(R).
To compute P(R) and P(Xi*R) efficiently, we can use DP. Let dp[i][j] be the probability of j out of the first n buyers buying something. P(R) and P(Xi*R) can be computed by the similar DP process and the same DP table.

PS. My old algorithm computes probability for all subsets of buyers to get the posterior probability, that is about one million possible combinations. It ran in 0.270s in uva11181.
