Simple problem. Since all the numbers are integers, we can traverse all possible values (i.e. [-500,500]). 
Also, we can make some optimizations. 
First, only one coefficient need to be negative. That reduces a lot of traverses. 
Second, skip those set of coefficients that are not relatively prime. This can further reduce my code's run time from 0.049s to 0.039s.

My code runs in 0.039s in uva.
