Max-flow problem.

We can split each regulator into two nodes in the network, with all incident links connected to one node and all outgoing links to the other node, and a new arc with capacity being that of the regulator connecting these two nodes. And then traditional max-flow algorithm will be applied.
I use Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

PS. I found a code for this problem in the Internet(http://www.cnblogs.com/riasky/p/3433222.html) which is faster and ran in 0s in uva 10330. However, after carefully inspected, I found it's wrong because it doesn't consider reverse arcs in residual graphs. Consider the following example, whose answer should be 20, but this code results in 10.
