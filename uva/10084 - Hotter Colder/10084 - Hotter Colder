Keyword:
geometry, computational geometry, midperpendicular, split of convex polygon

First, calculate the intersection points of the polygon and the midperpendicular of the consecutive two points. Then, cut the polygon into a smaller one according to "Hotter" or "Colder". Then calculate the area of the resulting small polygon.
