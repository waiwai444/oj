Simulation.

The way to think this problem is quite straightforward, but to code it correctly is a rather troublesome task. This is largely because its description is quite lengthy and there are a lot of details and pitfalls.

We can use a priority queue to keep track of the time an operating room finished its surgery. See the code for the details of the algorithm.

Notice that, the problem text doesn't describe the exact output format in detail. I referred to the output of uDebug to avoid meaningless WA trials for the output format.

There is another key point that is hidden in this sentence: "If two patients emerge from surgery at the same time, the patient with the lower number will be the first assigned to a recovery room bed."
Here, "the lower number" refers to the number of the operating room, not the number of the patient in the roster. I got all WA's due to this annoying pitfall.
