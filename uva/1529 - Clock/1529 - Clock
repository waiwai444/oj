Each hour except 11 and 12 has exactly one cross point for the hour hand and the minute hand in minutes 1 to 59. The remaining one cross point is 12:00. Then just count the number of cross points according to the initial time and the end time. See the code for details.

Notice that there are two fixed hidden output lines in this problem at the very first line and the last line. I got a WA without them. After searching the internet I see these hidden lines... -_-
