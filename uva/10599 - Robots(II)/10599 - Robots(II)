DP

Since we need to compute the number of longest paths, and paths are only different on their garbage locations, so I model the garbage locations as nodes in a graph, and then use DP on this graph to compute the maximum number of gabages collected and the number of such paths.
Edges are from node A to node B iff, when picks up them, no other node(garbage) can be picked up between them.
To facilitate constructing the graph, link lists for every row are introduced, each of which links all garbages in that row.
