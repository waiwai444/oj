I model this problem as a directed graph with 26 nodes for each character. Each directed edge is a word that connects the node for the first character to that for the last character. Then, check if there is a Eulerian path or cycle in this graph. 
Since we don’t need to output the path or the cycle, we don’t need to record the whole graph. See the code for details.
