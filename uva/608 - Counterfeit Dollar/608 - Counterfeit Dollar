12 coin weighing problem

1) If coins in the left balance and the right balance are of the same weight, then these coins are all normal ones. 
2) If a coin was in a lighter balance at some time and in a heavy balance at another time, then this coin is normal.
3) If in one weighing the two balances are of different weights, then all other coins are normal. 
Since the solution in this problem is always guaranteed to be uniquely determined, these three items suffice to find out the fake one.
