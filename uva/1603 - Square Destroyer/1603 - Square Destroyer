Brute force

My solution is to do DFS by squares. At the initialization phase, compute all the relations between squares and matchsticks for different board sizes. And then use DFS with some kinds of pruning for each input.

I also tried DFS by matchsticks, but it's much slower than that by squares. Maybe it's due to my poor implementation and pruning.
