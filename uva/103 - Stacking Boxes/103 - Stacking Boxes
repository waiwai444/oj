We can construct a DAG to represent the nesting relationship between boxes. That is, if a box can be nested in another one, then there's an arc pointing to that one from this box. 
Then we can use DFS on this DAG to find the longest path.
To check that one box can be nested in another one, use greedy strategy. (See the code.)
