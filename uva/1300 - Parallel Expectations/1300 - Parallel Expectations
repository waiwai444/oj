DP, Probability, Expectation

Interesting but quite complicated. The interesting part is about the process of DP, which involves probability and expectations.
First, we have to parse the input commands to internal sequences of instructions and variables, which is quite boring and error-prone. Be careful.
Then, for the DP, we use two arrays to record states during DP. Let dp[i][j] record all expectation values regarding variables and registers when we have executed to instruction i of program 1 and instruction j of program 2. And let prob[i][j] be the probability for instruction i of program 1 and instruction j of program 2 to be executed by the machine for the first i+j executions.

The reason we can calculate directly through expectations is because expectation is linear, i.e. E(X+Y)=EX+EY.
When there are two ways to proceed during DP, the result of expectation value will be calculated by conditional law of total expectation.

Notice that, the results are expectations, not the average values among all possible execution sequences, and different execution sequences will have different probabilities.

PS. The judges in uva1300 and icpcarchive2344 require a blank line after the last test case, which is not mentioned in the description of this problem. This caused me WA many times.
