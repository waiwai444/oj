Eulerian cycle

A simple Eulerian cycle problem. Note that the graph may be disconnected.
I use DFS to check connectivity.

It’s strange that if the graph is disconnected but all edges are in a connected subgraph, then we can just check the Eulerian cycle in that subgraph. (Why exist isolated points?) However, if there’s no edge at all, it will always be “Not Possible”.
