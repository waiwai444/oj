Josephus problem

Of course, we can use simulation to solve it, but dynamic programming is a better choice.

Consider the original Josephus problem where we remove every m-th number. Let the number start from 0, and let f(n) denote the last removed number, we have:
    f(n) = (m+f(n-1))%n

By using this recursive equation, we can easily compute the result by dynamic programming.

Notice that, in this problem, we remove the first number immediately at the beginning.
