simple c-like expression parsing

No need to use any complicated method like expression tree. Just scan the expression once and do the calculation.

0.035s (22/1035) in uva

Same problem:
	poj 1539 (Note that the input length is different there, which got me WA once in uva since I copied the code from there...)
	poj 3337 (The number of test cases is specified explicitly, and the output format is a little bit different.)
