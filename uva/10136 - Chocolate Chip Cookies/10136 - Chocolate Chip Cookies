This problem is to check the maximum number of points in a circle with fixed diameter on the plane. Since there are infinite number of circles with fixed diameter on a plane, we can not traverse all such circles. Instead, we can use two points between which the distance is less than or equal to the diameter to get such a circle. It only requires simple geometrical deduction to get the formula. Then we count the number of points in all such circles to find the maximum value. 

Although the time complexity is O(n^3), it's still good enough. My code runs in 0.019s in uva (rank 73 at the time I submitted it).
