Simulation.

Proceed along the time line and handle each incoming new request and each staff who has finished their current job. I used a priority queue to select the most prioritized staff at each time point.

In order to speed up, do not traverse each time point. Just visit time points that have new requests arriving or have some staffs finishing their jobs.

PS. The output in uDebug is different from mine. I don't know why...
