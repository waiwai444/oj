DP

Let dp[i][j][k] be the number of such words in alphabet {0, ..., i}, of length j, and with last digit being k. And tot[i][j] be the total number of words in alphabet {0, ..., i} and of length j. And ans[i][j] be the answer.
Note that this problem requires the percentage, we can use "double" to record values in DP instead of the boring bignum.
