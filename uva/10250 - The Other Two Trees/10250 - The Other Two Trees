Given such two points, the positions of the other two points is fixed, no matter what shape the parallelogram has. This can be proved as follows:
We can first connect the two points with a line, then make two squares whose centers are these two points vertical to this line, with the same size. Then, all parallelograms can be generated by changing the size of these two squares or rotating them simultaneously. We can show that such transformation doesn't change the positions of the other two points. 
1) Resize the two squares: It's trivial. 
2) Rotate the two squares: Connect one of the other two points, denoted as C (in the third square), with two points which are two vertices of the two squares, are adjacent in the parallelogram, and are on the edge closer to point C. Keep these two connections after rotation. The result can be proved by showing that the two angles scanned by these two connections are the same (it's easy), so that the angle between these two connections is still perpendicular. It means the center of the third square is unchanged. 
Combining the above two items will obtain any shape of parallelogram.
