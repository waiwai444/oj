This problem can be seen as an interval covering problem. So the greedy algorithm can be applied. 
We can use the crossing points of circles and the rectangle as the starting and the ending points of intervals. 
Those circles with radius less than or equal to half of the width, and those with crossing points not inside the horizontal edge, can be ignored. Since if there's a area that only they can cover, then there must exist areas that no circle can cover. 

p.s.: There may exist some precision problem with this problem. Since if I remove type conversions "(double)" in "sqrt((double)rad*rad-(double)width*width/4.0)", it will get WA.
