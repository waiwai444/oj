Tree DP

First, we construct the tree. And then start from an arbitrary node as the root for the tree DP.

For each node i, we define three values as follows.
1. min[i][0]: the perfect service number when it's neither the server itself nor covered by one of its children.
2. min[i][1]: the perfect service number when it's not a server itself but is covered by exactly one of it's children.
3. min[i][2]: the perfect service number when it's a server by itself.

See the code for the details of the DP equation.
