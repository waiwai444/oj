Floodfill

Use floodfill algorithm to mark the area that can be reached from the starting point. Then check each contour point and paint.

PS. It seems that the data set for this problem is not consistent with what the problem text said. It may have more than 30 lines or more than 80 characters in a line for a single grid. (Or it may be just some of my bug?) This caused me runtime error several times.
