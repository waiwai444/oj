A very very simple problem. Just one thing - the maximum number is 2^32. So "int" will not suffice. I use "long long" to get AC. But I found a sample code which is also AC using "long". Does it mean that in uva's server, "long" is as the same word length as "long long"? (64bit cpu?)

My code runs in 0.068s in uva.
