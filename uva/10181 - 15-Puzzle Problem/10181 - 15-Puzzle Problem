I used the A* algorithm[1,2] in the code. The scoring function uses the Manhattan distance. With different scoring functions, it has different performances. When the ratio of the coefficients of g*(n) and h*(n) is 1:2 [3], the running time in UVa is 0.060sec. Other ratio that I have tried includes 0:1(TLE), 1:1(7.216sec), 1:4/3 [4](0.400sec).
In order to quickly judge whether an initial board layout is solvable, we can use some result from math[5], or otherwise it's likely to be TLE.
