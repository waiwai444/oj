I use binary search and greedy algorithm to solve this problem. 
First, use binary search to find out the minimum value. To check if a value is a candidate, use greedy algorithm. 
Then, another greedy algorithm is used to find the partition with that minimum value according to the requirement. 
Refer to the code for the details.

The correctness of these two greedy algorithm is easy to prove.
