Binary search

First, for the simplest case, when the output is a constant no matter what x is, then we can choose either all 0 or all 1 as the answer.
Then, when the outputs for x=0 and x=1 are different, we can binary search the answer.
For example, if
00000000 -> 0
11111111 -> 1
then we can check 11110000.
If 11110000 -> 0, it means 1111xxxx has the same output. So, we can fix the first 4 inputs as 1, and continue searching in the last 4 inputs. And then, if 11111100 -> 1, it means 1111xx00 has the same output, so that we can fix the last 2 inputs as 0 and continue searching for the remaining 2 undetermined x's.
And in the final result, there is only 1 x in such cases.
