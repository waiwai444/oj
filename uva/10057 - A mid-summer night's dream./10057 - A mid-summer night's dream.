math

First, it's easy to see that the minimum and the maximum possible value of A is in the input integer set. 
Second, it's also easy to prove that the value of the formula descends, then possibly remains unchanged, and then ascends, as the value of A increases. The idea of the proof is quite straightforward, but writing it down is a little bit tedious. So I'll ignore it here. 
Third, to compare adjacent candidate values, we only need to compare the number of values larger than that value and the number of values less than or equal to that value. 

Based on the above facts, we can implement an efficient algorithm, which is O(n), to solve this problem.
